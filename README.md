# Spaceship Lost Passengers Prediction (Machine Learning) -
While a Shapceship is on a Voayage transporting passengers from Earth to an ExoPlanet a spacetime anamoly interupts the journey & many passengers disappears. And the ship lost data of passengers during We are asked to use the data of successfully transported passengers & analyze thier journey condition and predict existence of other passengers with their limited avaialable data. 
     - A binary classification problem statement.   
     - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis. 
     - Feature transformation, Data Preprocessing     
     - Model Building (Ensemble techniques)
     - Hyper-parameter Optimization, Cross validation
